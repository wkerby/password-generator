# Password Generator Starter Code
## Description

As part of our third weekly challenge, we were asked to use JavaScript to create an interactive password generator with the help of index.html and style.css boilerplate. We were tasked with applying our knowledge of conditional statments and loops to interpret user input and apply validation to the generated password.

As part of this assignment, I applied my newly-learned skills in the following:

- JavaScript coditional statements
- JavaScript objects 
- JavaScript string methods
- JavaScript functions
- JavaScript array methods

## Usage

Here you will find a link to the deployed webpage:

*https://wkerby.github.io/password-generator/

## Credits

The portfolio website was completed in conjunction with the software development boot camp provided by the Georgia Tech professional development program.

Some useful pages I used to help me though the assignment include:

*https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push

## Features

- Fragmented links that direct end-user to the relevant portion of the webpage
- Clickable image links that direct end-user to the refactored Horiseon website from challenge (and will direct him/her to other pertinent projects as class progresses)
- style.css file compliant with semantic html and compliant with responsive web design
