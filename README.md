# Password Generator Starter Code
## Description

As part of our third weekly challenge, we were asked to use JavaScript to create an interactive password generator with the help of index.html and style.css boilerplate. We were tasked with applying our knowledge of conditional statments and loops to interpret user input and apply validation to the generated password.

As part of this assignment, I applied my newly-learned skills in the following:

- JavaScript coditional statements
- JavaScript objects 
- JavaScript string methods
- JavaScript functions
- JavaScript array methods

## Usage
